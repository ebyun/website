### About Me

In September 2022, I started an assistant professor position at the Department of Earth System Sciences in Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea. I'm hoping to continue my studies on wetlands for their wide ranges of functions in the Earth system and for obtaining paleoecological/paleoenvironmental proxy records from their sediments (research interests  below).

### Research interests
I have broad interests in wetlands, paleoecology, land carbon cycle, and data in earth sciences. Specifically for wetlands and paleoecology, (i) evaluate local wetlands for carbon sequestration, stormwater management, and water quality improvement in urban areas, (ii) obtain long sediment cores from natural wetlands to reconstruct Quaternary paleoecological and climatic changes, and (iii) estimate historically drained wetlands to restore geological connections and functions in a watershed. 

For the topics regarding the land carbon cycle and data, (i) understand the complex nature of earth sciences data as shown in many land carbon studies, (ii) improve current practices in presenting, sharing, and archiving data, and (iii) conduct new multidisciplinary analysis utilizing existing data for new insights.
