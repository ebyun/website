### About Me

I'm currently a postdoc researcher at the [Ecohydrology Research Group](https://uwaterloo.ca/ecohydrology/), University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. From September 2022, I'll be joining the Department of Earth System Sciences at the Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, as a new faculty member. I'm looking for students and postdocs who would be interested in building a new lab together, in a highly supportive environment!

### Research interests[^2]
I have broad interests in wetlands, paleoecology, land carbon cycle, and data in earth sciences. Specifically for wetlands and paleoecology, (i) evaluate local wetlands for carbon sequestration, stormwater management, and water quality improvement in urban areas, (ii) obtain long sediment cores from natural wetlands to reconstruct Quaternary paleoecological and climatic changes (pollen, radiocarbon dating, and ancient DNA[^3]), and (iii) estimate historically drained wetlands to restore geological connections and functions in a watershed. 

For the topics regarding the land carbon cycle and data, (i) understand the complex nature of earth sciences data as shown in many land carbon studies, (ii) improve current practices in presenting, sharing, and archiving data, and (iii) conduct new multidisciplinary analysis utilizing existing data for new insights.
