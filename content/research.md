#### 1. Permafrost and carbon cycle
Sporadic but very high concentrations of methane were measured from winter air pockets created by downward freezing of active layer soils and possibly from winter soil microbial activities in permafrost regions. The potential methane release by spring soil thaw can be one of the reasons for the field observed abrupt increases in permafrost methane emission rates. (details in this short communication article: [*"Trapped Greenhouse Gases in the Permafrost Active Layer"*](https://doi.org/10.1002/ppp.1935))

A following study showed that the high concentrations of soil trapped methane were closely associated with high abundance of methane-producing microbial communities. This finding provides support to the potentially active winter soil respiration despite low temperature conditions. (details in this article led by Binu Mani Tripathi and Mincheol Kim: [*"Variations in bacterial and archaeal communities along depth profiles of Alaskan soil cores"*](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-18777-x))

Polar ice cores preserve ancient air informing the contemporary atmospheric compositions. Ice wedges formed underground in permafrost regions also have trapped air pockets but heavily influenced by soil microbial activities, showing high levels of greenhouse gases. Nevertheless, the water isotope compositions of layered ground ice may inform the contemporary water source areas of the past environments. Likewise, the ice-wedge ices have potential to be useful for paleoclimate reconstruction of those inland areas lacking other types of paleo proxy records.

#### 2. Wetlands and paleoecology
Many natural wetlands were drained and converted by European settlement in North America. Earlier land management studies well inventoried the estimated land use changes upon wetland drainage and conversion across southern Ontario, Canada, but carbon pool loss was not the topic in the past. This study using old maps and overlays estimated the total regional carbon pool loss by wetland categories, and importantly noted the ongoing importance of swamp-type wetlands relatively still abundant due to high resilience to land clearance in the region's settlement history. (read the full story in [*"Potential carbon loss associated with post-settlement wetland conversion in southern Ontario, Canada"*](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13021-018-0094-4))

In dominantly agricultural landscape of the southern Ontario, there is outstanding forest cover showing the unique boundary of Greenock Swamp wetlands. This swamp is the largest remaining continuous wetland of the region, and we conducted the first investigation on its paleoecological history based on pollen records. (check out the publication with pollen diagrams:
[*"Holocene regional climate and formation of southern Ontario's largest swamp inferred from a kettle-lake pollen record"*](https://doi.org/10.1017/qua.2021.54))

In collaboration with wetland researchers, we conducted data compilation for swamp sites across Canada and the US, about different types of wetland ecosystem carbon pools, such as gas flux, biomass, and soil (I was in the team soil). While the results show significance of the recognized carbon pools, discussion addresses how swamps have been relatively set aside from the regional wetland studies for carbon pool importance. ([*"The unrecognized importance of carbon stocks and fluxes from swamps in Canada and the USA"*](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac63d5) led by Scott Davidson)

Broadly speaking, swamp is forest, with trees that can survive on very wet soils. It is also a wetland, though the water table is not always as high as other types of wetlands yearlong. Lake sediment pollen records are usually interpreted for the past changes in upland trees and non-swamp forests because swampy lowland forests, if any, should be a minor component of the landscape and thus for the regional pollen rains. However, during the late glacial period, certain pollen taxa constantly remained high without clear reasons if only based on the current forest observations (i.e., no modern analogue). We hypothesized this no-analog pollen signaling very extensive past wetlands during the late glacial time supported by melting ice sheets and unique climate. Although limited, other paleoecological and geological evidence seems to agree very high abundance of wetlands in the region.

#### 3. Climate impacts on northern peatlands 
Climate change is more rapid and dramatic in northern high latitudes where we find vast peatlands and unique permafrost landscapes casually storing (mega)tons of carbon in their organic soils. Many studies have discussed the vulnerability of this carbon pool under climate warming, because of increasing microbial decomposition with rising temperature. We compared multiple peatland locations in terms of temperature and moisture dependence of peat soil respiration rates using lab incubation technique. Results show significant difference among sites with implications on the terrestrial carbon cycle modeling:
[*"Temperature, moisture and freeze-thaw controls on CO2 production in soil incubations from northern peatlands"*](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-02606-3)

Growing season activities are important for carbon cycling of any ecosystem, but the non-growing season is critical for northern high latitude ecosystems given the length and importantly that cold-adapted microbes can respire carbon throughout the season. But how to define the start and end of the non-growing season has not been well established among studies. We explored how the difference of non-growing season definition can influence the cumulative net ecosystem carbon exchange estimated for a given peatland site, and recommend future studies not to disregard this altering effect:
[*"The definition of the non-growing season matters: a case study of net ecosystem carbon exchange from a Canadian peatland"*](https://doi.org/10.1088/2515-7620/ac53c2)
